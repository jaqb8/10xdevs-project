## Check Project Version

Check for version prompted by user in prompt. If there is no version in prompt, use the latest version from the GitHub releases with the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/jaqb8/10xdevs-project/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name, .name, .published_at'
```

Then, check if the project version is correct in the `package.json` file and `README.md` file.

- Check if the project version is correct in the `package.json` file
- Check if the project version is correct in the `README.md` file

Also, if there is no changelog in docs/v{version}/changelog.md file, create it based on commits between the previous and current version. Use the following command to get the commits:

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" v{previous-version}..v{current-version}
```

Then, create the changelog file in the docs/v{version}/changelog.md file in english.

```markdown
# Language Learning Buddy v{version}

## What's New

## Fixed

## Changed
```
